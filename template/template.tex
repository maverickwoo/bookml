\documentclass[oneside,11pt]{amsart}

%%% recommended for PDF quality: better handling of accented characters and ligatures
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%%% REQUIRED for accessibility: set the language for the output (here 'en-GB')
\usepackage[british]{babel}

%%% REQUIRED for correct formatting and tagging of BookML output: title and author
\title{A short BookML example}
\author{Vincenzo Mantova}
\date{21th March 2023}

%%% RECOMMENDED for PDF quality: enable clickable links and metadata in PDFs
% the option pdfusetitle adds \author and \title to the PDF metadata
\usepackage[pdfusetitle]{hyperref}

%%% RECOMMENDED for PDF quality: higher quality equivalent of Computer Modern
\usepackage{lmodern}

%%% OPTIONAL: additional BookML and LaTeXML functionality
\usepackage{bookml/bookml}

%%% REQUIRED for TikZ: use bmlImageEnvironment for TikZ and other images, since
%%%                    LaTeXML is slow and often produces garbled TikZ output
%%%                    (this requires \usepackage{bookml/bookml})
% tell BookML to compile tikzpicture and tikzcd environments into images via LaTeX
\bmlImageEnvironment{tikzpicture,tikzcd}
% hide all TikZ-related commands from LaTeXML, but leave them when generating the PDF
\iflatexml            % are we compiling through LaTeXML?
\else
\usepackage{tikz}     % if not, load TikZ as usual
\usetikzlibrary{cd}
\usepackage[all]{xy}
% other TikZ-related command MUST be here, before \fi
\fi

%%% OPTIONAL for accessibility: additional versions of the document (e.g. large print)
% the additional formats will be recompiled automatically whenever there are changes
% you may use "\jobname" instead of "template" to pick up the name from this very file
\bmlAltFormat{template.pdf}{PDF (serif)} % always included; here \bmlAltFormat simply changes its label
\bmlAltFormat{template-sans.pdf}{PDF (sans serif)}
\bmlAltFormat{template-sans-large.pdf}{PDF (sans, large)}

% template-sans.tex, template-sans-large.tex \input this file after running some commands
% to change font and print size
% e.g. template-sans-large.tex defines '\bmlCrop' and selects the options for the crop
% package using '\PassOptionsToPackage'
\ifcsname bmlCrop\endcsname % is \bmlCrop defined?
\usepackage{crop}           % if so, load the package crop
\fi

% used here to customise the 'description' environment
\usepackage{enumitem}

\begin{abstract}
  A minimal document to show and test how BookML works, including additional large print PDFs.
\end{abstract}

%%% OPTIONAL: footer for HTML output, here for a copyright notice
