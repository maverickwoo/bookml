%%% common LaTeX classes will work fine
\documentclass[oneside,11pt]{amsart}

%%% recommended for PDF quality: better handling of accented characters and ligatures
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%%% REQUIRED for accessibility: set the language for the output (here 'en-GB')
\usepackage[british]{babel}

%%% REQUIRED for correct formatting and tagging of BookML output: title and author
\title{Title}
\author{Author}
\date{Date}

%%% RECOMMENDED for PDF quality: enable clickable links and metadata in PDFs
% the option pdfusetitle adds \author and \title to the PDF metadata
\usepackage[pdfusetitle]{hyperref}

%%% RECOMMENDED for PDF quality: higher quality equivalent of Computer Modern
\usepackage{lmodern}

%%% OPTIONAL: additional BookML and LaTeXML functionality
\usepackage{bookml/bookml}

%%% REQUIRED for TikZ: use bmlImageEnvironment for TikZ and other images, since
%%%                    LaTeXML is slow and often produces garbled TikZ output
%%%                    (this requires \usepackage{bookml/bookml})
% tell BookML to compile tikzpicture and tikzcd environments into images via LaTeX
\bmlImageEnvironment{tikzpicture,tikzcd}
% hide all TikZ-related commands from LaTeXML, but leave them when generating the PDF
\iflatexml            % are we compiling through LaTeXML?
\else
\usepackage{tikz}     % if not, load TikZ as usual
\usetikzlibrary{cd}
\usepackage[all]{xy}
% other TikZ-related command MUST be here, before \fi
\fi

%%% OPTIONAL for accessibility: additional versions of the document (e.g. large print)
% the additional formats will be recompiled automatically whenever there are changes
% you may use "\jobname" instead of "template" to pick up the name from this very file
\bmlAltFormat{template.pdf}{PDF (serif)} % always included; here \bmlAltFormat simply changes its label
\bmlAltFormat{template-sans.pdf}{PDF (sans serif)}
\bmlAltFormat{template-sans-large.pdf}{PDF (sans, large)}

% very cheap way of generating a 'large print' PDF (~19% bigger)
\ifcsname bmlCrop\endcsname % is \bmlCrop defined?
\usepackage{crop}           % if so, load the package crop
\fi
%%% What is \bmlCrop?
% template-sans-large.tex uses \input{template.tex} to read this file.
% Before that, it defines \bmlCrop, so that the above code imports crop.
% It also uses \PassOptionsToPackage to tweak the options of crop.
% The result has identical pagination as the normal PDF so you do not need
% to review both versions.
%
% However, the magnification is very limited. If you need larger magnification,
% you may have to use a larger font, in which case the large print PDF will
% will look different and must be reviewed regularly.

%%% OPTIONAL: footer for HTML output, for instance a copyright notice
% note that the footer does not appear in the PDF
