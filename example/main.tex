\documentclass{book}

% required by BookML: use T1 font enconding
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% required for accessibility: set the language for the output (in this case, en-GB)
\usepackage[british]{babel}

% required for correct formatting and tagging of BookML output: title and author
\title{A minimal BookML example}
\author{Vincenzo Mantova}

% abstract (which will become the SCORM package description)
\newenvironment{abstract}{}{}
\usepackage{abstract}

% optional but recommended: additional BookML and LaTeXML functionality
\usepackage{bookml/bookml}

% optional but recommended: enable clickable links in PDFs
% the option pdfusetitle adds \author and \title to the PDF metadata
\usepackage[pdfusetitle]{hyperref}

% recommended: use bmlImageEnvironment for image heavy content, such as TikZ, where LaTeXML is slow and often produces garbled output
% this command declares tikzpicture and tikzcd environments to be compiled via LaTeX instead of LaTeXML
\bmlImageEnvironment{tikzpicture,tikzcd}

% this hides the tikz, xy packages and some tikz-related commands from LaTeXML
\iflatexml
\else
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{cd}
\usepackage[all]{xy}

\begin{abstract}
  A minimal document to show and test how BookML works.
\end{abstract}

To compile this document, simply run \texttt{make} in this folder (or possibly \texttt{gmake} if you are on Windows). BookML will generate a file \texttt{\jobname.zip} containing the HTML output generated by LaTeXML. You can also view the output in \texttt{\jobname/index.html}.

By default, each section will create a separate page. Try running \texttt{make SPLITAT=} to have all sections in a single file, or \texttt{make SPLITAT=chapter} to have a separate page per chapter. If you do so, run \texttt{make clean} first, or manually delete the folder \texttt{\jobname} and \texttt{\jobname.zip}.

You may also modify \texttt{Makefile} to permanently change how pages are split, or to indicate a different splitting strategy for different zip packages.

\textbf{Requirements:} you must have \texttt{latexmk} in your MikTeX/TeXLive distribution, GNU Make, \texttt{zip} on macOS and Linux or 7-zip on Windows, and of course LaTeXML.

\textbf{Multiple files:} note that you will find a \texttt{secondfile.zip} file as well. Each \texttt{.tex} file in this folder containing \texttt{\textbackslash{}documentclass} gets its own zip package. Try creating a new \LaTeX{} document \texttt{thirdfile.tex} and run \texttt{make} again.
